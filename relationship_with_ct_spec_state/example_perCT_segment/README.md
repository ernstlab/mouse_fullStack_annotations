- Each ```.bed.gz``` file in this folder represents the chromatin state annotation for one cell type (sample) from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2093-3"> Gorkin et al., 2020 </a>. We provide just 3 files, and only data for chromosome 19, for the sake of demonstration. If you want to replicate what we did to obtain Fig. S6+7 in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22653-8#Sec35">Kwon and Ernst, 2021 </a>, you will have to download raw data provided in the paper.
- File ```tissue_annotation.csv``` shows metadata about different tissue types from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2093-3"> Gorkin et al., 2020 </a>, so that we can color and group the cell types that have per-ct annotations. Columns: tissue_stage, ct, stage, color, group --> needed later for plotting and grouping the cell types by their tissue groups, along with color codes.

- File ```15_state_annotations.csv``` shows metadata about 15 different states from the per-ct annotations, so what we can color the per-ct states as in Fig. S7 in the manuscript.
